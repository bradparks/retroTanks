RetroTanks v1.0
==========

RetroTanks: Atari Combat Reimagined, built in Meteor.

## Overview
RetroTanks is a project I wrote to learn [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/ "Meteor"). It's based on Atari Combat
(1977), which originally supported two players. Against my better judgement,
RetroTanks supports an unlimited number of players. There are currently four
spawn points, but you can always add more.

This is a great isomorphic JavaScript example. The grand majority of the codebase runs
on both client and server. You can blow out some of the principles I have here to combat
cheating on the server side, create AI bots, and have in-depth front-side unit testing.
