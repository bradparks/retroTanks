RetroTanks v1.0
==========

RetroTanks: Atari Combat Reimagined, built in Meteor

## Overview
RetroTanks is a project I wrote to learn Meteor. It's based on Atari Combat
(1977), which originally supported two players. Against my better judgement,
RetroTanks supports an unlimited number of players. There are currently four
spawn points, but you can always add more.
